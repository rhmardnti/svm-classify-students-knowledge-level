This project aims to classify students' knowledge level by using Support Vector Machine.
in this case, there are 5 input variables. they are namely, STG (The degree of study time for goal object materials), SCG (The degree of repetition number of users for goal object materials) STR (The degree of study time of user for related objects with goal object) LPR (The performance of user for related objects with goal object) PEG (The performance of user for goal objects), and one classifier UNS (The knowledge level of user)
